# Students Name and GWA
Read a file with student's name and gwa to get the highest.

# ❓ How to run this program:
- The program will read a text file that contains name and gwa of student
- After reading the text file it will separate name and gwa considering the symbol ","
- From the separation it will now identify what is the highest gwa
- The program uses "min" to identify which is the highest since the general highest gwa is 1.0
- Check the text file and consider students who got 1.0 to verify the printed highest students.
